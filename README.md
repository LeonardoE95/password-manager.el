# Password-Manager.el

This repositories contain simple abstractions that can be used to
interact with different password managers within the comfort of Emacs.

As of right now, only the `Bitwarden` password manager is
supported. In the future, I will also want to support `KeePass` and
maybe other password managers.

For each password manager, a simple `transient` based interface will
be offered to ease out the interaction flows.

If you have any feedback, feel free to open issues or let me know by
email.
